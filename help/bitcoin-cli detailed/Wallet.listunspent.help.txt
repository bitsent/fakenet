listunspent ( minconf maxconf  ["addresses",...] [include_unsafe] )

Returns array of unspent transaction outputs
with between minconf and maxconf (inclusive) confirmations.
Optionally filter to only include txouts paid to specified addresses.

Arguments:
1. minconf          (numeric, optional, default=1) The minimum confirmations to filter
2. maxconf          (numeric, optional, default=9999999) The maximum confirmations to filter
3. "addresses"    (string) A json array of bitcoin addresses to filter
    [
      "address"   (string) bitcoin address
      ,...
    ]
4. include_unsafe (bool, optional, default=true) Include outputs that are not safe to spend
                  because they come from unconfirmed untrusted transactions or unconfirmed
                  replacement transactions (cases where we are less sure that a conflicting
                  transaction won't be mined).

Result
[                   (array of json object)
  {
    "txid" : "txid",          (string) the transaction id 
    "vout" : n,               (numeric) the vout value
    "address" : "address",    (string) the bitcoin address
    "account" : "account",    (string) DEPRECATED. The associated account, or "" for the default account
    "scriptPubKey" : "key",   (string) the script key
    "amount" : x.xxx,         (numeric) the transaction output amount in BSV
    "confirmations" : n,      (numeric) The number of confirmations
    "redeemScript" : n        (string) The redeemScript if scriptPubKey is P2SH
    "spendable" : xxx,        (bool) Whether we have the private keys to spend this output
    "solvable" : xxx,         (bool) Whether we know how to spend this output, ignoring the lack of keys
    "safe" : xxx              (bool) Whether this output is considered safe to spend. Unconfirmed transactions
                              from outside keys are considered unsafe and are not eligible for spending by
                              fundrawtransaction and sendtoaddress.
