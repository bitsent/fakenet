getblockbyheight height ( verbosity ) 

If verbosity is 0 or RAW_BLOCK, returns a string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'.
If verbosity is 1 or DECODE_HEADER, returns an Object with information about block <hash>.
If verbosity is 2 or DECODE_TRANSACTIONS, returns an Object with information about block <hash> and information about each transaction. 
If verbosity is 3 or DECODE_HEADER_AND_COINBASE, returns a json object with block information and the coinbase transaction. 

Arguments:
1. "height"             (numeric, required) The block height
2. verbosity              (numeric or string, optional, default=1) 0 (RAW_BLOCK) for hex encoded data, 1 (DECODE_HEADER) for a json object, 2 (DECODE_TRANSACTIONS) for json object with transaction data and 3 (DECODE_HEADER_AND_COINBASE) for a json object with coinbase only

Result (for verbosity = 0 or verbosity = RAW_BLOCK):
"data"             (string) A string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'.
